## Language Translator

### Description and Motivation
The purpose of this program is to translate any language into another language of your choice.
This is possible with the help of importing translate onto the program.you can redirect a file if you want to read it in a different language,there are 71 languages you can choose from.

### Prior Art
Many translasting applications exist, you input what you want and select the langauge output. We aren't remaking how translating works but we will have things different than others. We will be making a translating project with *googletrans 3.0.0*. We chose *googletrans 3.0.0* beacuse its updated and is known.

The user will input what they want and select the language. This is the basics of every translating application, the user will also be able to translate items from a file. Smart translating from *googletrans 3.0.0* will detect the language you are speaking in and translate to the desired language.
